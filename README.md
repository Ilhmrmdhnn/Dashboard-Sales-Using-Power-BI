## Overview:
This sales dashboard provides a comprehensive view of sales performance across multiple dimensions, including time, geography, products, and market segments. It offers interactive features to analyze sales data.

## Key Features:

3. Profit Trend Visualization: A line graph displays profit trends over time, showing fluctuations and overall trajectory.
4. Geographical Profit Distribution: An interactive world map visualizes profit by country, with bubble sizes indicating relative profit levels.
5. Product and Segment Analysis: A stacked bar chart breaks down sales by product (Paseo, VTT, Velo, Amarilla, Carretera) across different market segments (Channel Partners, Enterprise, Government, Midmarket, Small Business).

## Objective Insights:

* 'VTT' and 'Velo' also show strong performance, particularly in certain segments.

4. Market Segment Analysis:
